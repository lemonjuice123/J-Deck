# J Deck - Cyber Deck Prototype

## Description

Welcome to the **J Deck** repository! This project aims to create a versatile cyber deck utilizing the **ESP8266 NodeMCU** as the primary processor and the **ESP32** as a secondary processor. The cyber deck is equipped with a **SSD1306 OLED display** (128x64), providing a compact and efficient interface for various applications.

### Overview

The J Deck is designed for experimentation and development, serving as a platform for learning and expanding your skills in embedded systems, IoT, and user interface design. The ESP8266 handles the main processing tasks, while the ESP32 communicates via UART, accepting commands and executing code accordingly.

### Features

- **ESP8266 NodeMCU**: Main controller for managing the cyber deck's operations.
- **ESP32**: Secondary processor that takes UART commands and executes tasks.
- **SSD1306 OLED Display**: Displays information and user interface elements in a compact format.
- **Prototype Stage**: The project is currently in its prototype phase, allowing for ongoing development and improvements.
- **Open for Add-ons**: As a novice developer, I welcome contributions and enhancements from the community to expand the J Deckâ€™s capabilities.

### Project Goals

- Create a functional and user-friendly cyber deck that demonstrates the capabilities of the ESP8266 and ESP32.
- Implement basic command handling and execution through UART communication.
- Develop a library of reusable code snippets and modules for future add-ons and features.
